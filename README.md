## Terrain-Map
### Project Description
include picture of standard perspective and default position

### Prerequisites
This project implements the StdDraw library (https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdDraw.html), which uses built-in java libraries like java.awt and javax.swing. 
NOTE: StdDraw library is slightly modified to return abstracted JFrame (getFrame())

### Running the Program
Add option to use args[] or stdin

- Rotation by 45 degrees is applied to default points (set by Point.java)
- points are then mapped to plane z = zTilt*y
